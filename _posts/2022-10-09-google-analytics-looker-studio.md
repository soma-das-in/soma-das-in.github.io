In todayâ€™s age of digital marketing, it is imperative to have an online presence for businesses to stay relevant.  We look at a use case of how Google Looker Studio can be used to analyze Google Analytics data to provide insights for propelling business footprint and ROI.

Google Looker Studio, formerly Data Studio, is a tool that can be used to explore and visualize data from multiple sources in the form of customizable interactive dashboards which provide business insights and enable team collaboration. Google Looker Studio supports various connector types for Google Sheets, CSV file, Databases like BigQuery, MySQL, Google Marketing Platform products , Google Consumer products, Social media platforms, Blended data from a combination of related sources etc. 

Google Analytics is one of the leading web analytics platforms which helps track online traffic, understand customer engagement journeys across platforms, and how it influences user experience, conversion and retention.

The new version of Google Analytics , Google Analytics 4 or GA4 in short, provides more advanced cross device tracking capabilities, allowing website and app data to be collected as events in the same property, thereby allowing a more holistic understanding of customer journeys . It also provides enhanced data privacy controls and machine learning capabilities to identify trends and predict user behaviour.

In Google Looker studio we use dimensions and metrics for visualizations. Dimensions are labels or descriptions which represent the data and metrics are measurements or numeric values like SUM, AVG, COUNT etc.

Let us look at some of the key  steps required to create a holistic view  of customer engagement by integrating Google Looker Studio and Google Analytics.
